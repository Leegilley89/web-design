    <head> why i like dnd</head>
    <p>There is quite a few table top rpg's out there. Pathfinder, starwars, dc, marvel, lor of the rings, you name it theres a table top game for it. dnd can bring people togetther. You can let your imagination run free and you can do almost anyhting if you can get lucky with the dice. i like dnd because i can take a break from normal life. i can be a completly out of this world and do things you couldn't normally do other wise.</p>
    <head2>how you play</head2>
    <p2>You begin playing, in very simple terms, with a piece of paper. you write you name of the charater, pick a race from the 5th edition( or what you r dungeon master allows) pick a class. then you roll your stats. these are strength, dexterity, wisdom, constitution, intelligence, and charisma. essentially thats what you need to begin. It would take a few days to fully describe step by step how to begin. </p2>
